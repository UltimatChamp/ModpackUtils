title: Adding a Custom Chat Welcome Message
hide_meta: true
---

This one's pretty simple. This setting will display a chat message every time
the user joins a world.

You can also customize the chat message. The default one is
`Welcome to <modpack-name> <version>!`.
  - Here, the `<modpack-name>` and `<version>` placeholders are automatically
    filled based on the values specified in **Update Notifier**.

Here are some examples:

- `Another day of joy for you, thanks to <modpack-name>!`

- `--- [<modpack-name>] [<version>] ---`

Now, you should be all set! As always, if you still have any questions or if
something goes wrong, you can ask for help on our
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/kfKjjhv3pn).
