title: Adding a Custom Title
hide_meta: true

This one's also pretty simple. This setting will apply a custom title to your game window.

You can also set your own custom title. The default one is `<modpack-name> <version> | Minecraft <mc>`.
  - Here, the `<modpack-name>`, `<version>`, and `<mc>` placeholders are automatically filled based on the values specified in **Update Notifier**.

Here are some examples:

- `<modpack-name> <version> for Minecraft > <mc>`

- `<modpack-name> <version> | Minecraft <mc> | ~(=^‥^)ノ`

Now, you should be all set! As always, if you still have any questions or if something goes wrong, you can ask for help on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/kfKjjhv3pn).
