### On Modrinth/CurseForge

Let's start with a simple setup, for a modpack that is hosted on **Modrinth/CurseForge**.

This is the default config screen:

<ModAsset
  width="100%"
  title="ModpackUtils Config"
  location="mutils:mutils_config"
/>

- Let's start by enabling the `Menu Alert` and `Chat Alert` options.
  - `Menu Alert` shows a toast notifying you that an update is available.
  - `Chat Alert` shows a chat message every time you join a world.

<Callout variant="info">
  Tip! You can hover over other options to see what they do, by looking
  at the sidebar on the right.
</Callout>

- Set the `Modpack Name` and `Modpack ID` to your respective modpack's details.
  - Here, `Modpack ID` is your project's slug.
    `https://modrinth.com/modpack/<slug>`

- The `Local Version` field is filled with the current version of the modpack.
  This is updated every time you upload a new version.

- `Minecraft Version Check`, as the name suggests, fetches the modpack version
  compatible with the current Minecraft version.

- `Loader` fetches the modpack version compatible with the current modloader,
  _(`fabric`, `neoforge` or `forge`)_.

- `Version Types`, by default, fetches all types of releases
  _(`release`, `beta` and `alpha`)_, which may not be desired. You can remove
  `beta` and `alpha`, if it is a stable release.

- `Display Name Filters` fetches the modpack version with the display name
  containing all the filters here. This option can be set empty to disable
  it.

- `Version Number Filters` fetches the modpack version containing all the
  filters here. This option can also be set empty to disable it.

- If everything was done correctly, you should see a chat message when you join
  a new world.

<Callout variant="warning">
  Don't see anything? It might be because you're using the same version in the
  `Local Version` field as the current version on Modrinth. Try setting `Local
  Version` to an older version.
</Callout>

### On Any Other Platform

If your modpack is hosted on any platform other than **Modrinth**, you can use
the `Custom` option in the `Platform` setting. This option also supports
Packwiz!

You'll notice that some options have been greyed out, while some new options
have appeared.

For the existing options, you can refer to what we did in the **Modrinth**
section. Now, let's look at the new options:

- `Modpack Home`: This is the link to the home page/description of your website,
  where your modpack is available for download.
- `Version API`: If you're using Packwiz, you can use the link to your
  `pack.toml` file. If you aren't using Packwiz, you can just create a new
  `.txt` file with the `version` field.

  For example,

  ```toml title="ðŸ“„ pack.txt"
  version = "1.0.0"
  ```

- `Changelog Link`: This is the link to your latest changelog file. This same
  file is updated with every new version published. This file should **not** be
  renamed.

Now, you should be all set! If you still have any questions or if something goes
wrong, you can ask for help on our
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/kfKjjhv3pn).
