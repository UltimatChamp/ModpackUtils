To use a custom icon, first enable the `Custom Icon` setting
_<small>(duh)</small>_ in the `Window Utils` tab.

  On the first run, you might experience a crash. This is completely normal.
  This will be fixed once you add your icon files.

### Icon files

- To add a custom icon, you need the following icon files:
  - `icon_16x16.png`
  - `icon_32x32.png`
  - `icon_48x48.png`
  - `icon_128x128.png`
  - `icon_256x256.png`
  - `minecraft.icns` _<small>(For all your **macOS** users)</small>_

  a reliable web utility :P)_

Now, put these icon files in this location:

<FolderTreeIcon width={24} height={24} strokeWidth={1} />

```
.minecraft
└── config
    └── mutils
        └── icons
```
