This option is used to add lines of text to the **Title Screen** by using the
[**Main Menu Credits**](https://modrinth.com/mod/main-menu-credits). This option
can be enabled via the `MMC` tab.

There are three different styles:

- **Normal:** A simple text is shown on the **Title Screen**.
  <ModAsset width="50%" title="MMC Normal" location="mutils:mmc_normal" />
- **Fancy:** Detailed, colorful lines of text are shown on the **Title Screen**.
  <ModAsset width="50%" title="MMC Fancy" location="mutils:mmc_fancy" />
- **Custom:** This option is used to add custom lines of text to the **Title
  Screen.**

You don't need to do anything else if you're using the **Normal** or **Fancy**
option. It is recommended to use these settings in most cases.

Now let's start with the `Custom` option.

The custom option, by default, is set to use the `Fancy` setting's
configuration.

When you've changed the option to `Custom`, a new option will be displayed, as
you can see in the image below.

<ModAsset width="100%" title="MMC Config" location="mutils:mmc_config" />

Each line/entry on the **Title Screen** requires three attributes:

- **Text:** This is the text that will be displayed to the user on the **Title
  Screen**.
- **Color:** This should be a hex value like `#55FF55`. If you want the text to
  be just white, you can set the value to `#FFFFFF`.
- **Link:** The link that will open when the user clicks on the text.

You can add a new attribute by clicking on the `+` icon. By default, new entries
are added to the bottom of the **Title Screen**. You can rearrange the
attributes by clicking the `⬆️ ⬇️` buttons.

For example, if you want an entry at the top of the **Title Screen**, the
attributes of that entry should be placed at the bottom of the list in the
**Config Screen**.

Here, `<modpack-name>`, `<modpack-home>`, `<version>`, and `<version-link>`
placeholders are automatically filled based on the values specified in **Update
Notifier**.

Now, you should be all set! As always, if you still have any questions or if
something goes wrong, you can ask for help on our
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/kfKjjhv3pn).
