Ram Alert is used to warn the user if the RAM allocated to Minecraft is lower than what is required to run the modpack. You can display a toast on the **Title Screen** or just a simple message when the user joins a world. This is, again, a very simple option.

- `Ram Menu Alert` shows a toast on the **Title Screen** once, just after loading the game.
- `Ram Chat Alert` shows a chat message every time you join a world.

You can specify the minimum amount of RAM required by your modpack in the `Minimum Required RAM` field. The value should be in MiB.

That's right, it was this simple. Now, you should be all set! As always, if you still have any questions _<small>(I doubt there will be any)</small>_ or if something goes wrong, you can ask for help on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/kfKjjhv3pn).
